# The Gardeners Cooperative

User-Centric-Frontend-Development. Milestone-Project.

This website is to be used as: a portfolio for potential clients and a place for people to get in touch to work with us. It provides essential information on the nature & structure of the company, a portfolio of examples of our work plus a contact form with social media links.
 
## UX
 
The site was designed to be as user friendly as possible. As we are catering to most of west London I wanted to make sure that the UX was viable for elderly people, those with bad eye-sight and those who aren't comfortable using complex websites.

We work with nature and I wanted the design to acknowledge and represent that; I used natural colours like green, brown, lavender, sky-blue and blossom-pink. 

## Features
The carousel was added as a way to show many images of our work without taking up too much "real-estate". I incorporated parallax scrolling which adds a lot of depth to the site. The navbar has some animation and is stuck to the top of the screen for constant control over where you want to go.  

### Features Left to Implement
- When I have time I would like to add a sign-in option with 'Gardener' and 'Customer' account types. Gardeners would have access to message boards for all our workers to plan jobs, enlist help and seek work. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** for aiding placement and using established design trends such as FontAwesome icons and buttons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses the **Google Fonts** 'Exo' & 'Roboto' in varying weights and sizes.

## Testing

When I started this project I got about halfway through before I realised I hadn't made it truly responsive. After writing a silly number of media queries in some attempt to cover all screen sizes I decided to start again with a new, responsive foundation on which everything would work properly. Now the site looks good across all screen sizes including mobile, tablet, desktop and landscape-mobile.

If you don't enter required information in the contact form, it will not submit. An error message will display. This will also occur if an invalid email address is submitted. If all information is valid, the page will reload.

The 'About'/'Portfolio' section was made to take up as much space as the content requires to let the text and carousel respond to the screen size. Using the mobile simulator on Chrome Dev Tools you can see this working. The carousel controls have been tested to make sure they scroll properly on all devices.

The site works across many browsers including: Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. The site works across ALL mobile sizes. I had a terrible moment when I thought I had finished only to find that the site doesn't work on a on a mobile in landscape mode. Landscape now works perfectly on all mobiles.

## Deployment

I am hosting the site on GitHub pages on the master branch. If you want to run the code locally you can use 'git clone'. Alternatively you can download all the files in a .zip file and open 'index.html' in your file explorer.


## Credits

### Content

I built the Nav-bar and form from scratch. Content from the "About us" section was written by me. 


### Media
I used Pexels (stock images) for all my images, because people upload a whole photo shoot I could get a selection.
I cropped the images in the carousel so they were all the same size. I also darkened some images that needed higher contrast with the light text.


### Acknowledgements

- The Carousel is a bootstrap component. I added more spots for images in the carousel so that I could have more examples of our work. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/carousel/)

- I used the Bootstrap grid for responsive placement. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/)
